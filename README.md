- Simple triggerbot to change the triggerkey open the features.cpp and use anything from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)
- Simple bhop 
- Hitsounds
- Kernelmode to be undetectable by vac(or at least in theory)
- Every feature has its own triggerkey, Triggerbot F2, Bhop F4 and Hitsounds F6


## Compiling

Open it in visual studio and build as debug or as release whatever you like obv in x64

You will also need [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/) and [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/) for this to compile and run
## How to use it

You need to map the driver using soemthing like [KDmapper](https://github.com/TheCruZ/kdmapper) 

Then you need to run CS2 and open the usermode.exe.

Windows Defender probaly needs to be off but you can just whitelist the diretory 

Disable vulnerable driver list if enabled [Guide for that](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/kb5020779-the-vulnerable-driver-blocklist-after-the-october-2022-preview-release-3fcbe13a-6013-4118-b584-fcfbc6a09936)
## Note

I know this is horrible code and also horribly formatted but deal with it, its enough for me to work on it, if you dont understand what i did at acertain places ask me or ask copilot

## Future plans
- Currently the bhop isnt the best as it sometimes just fails to jump so i will improve that.
- I am also trying to get add a precision enhanced automatic target acquisition and engagement facilitation system protocol but i cant really get it to work 

## Updating

I cant guarentee that i will update this for every CS2 update so you can update the offsets yourself using [Cs-Dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper) and then just replace your current client.dll.hpp with the one by cs2-dumper and do the same for offsets.hpp
## Authors
- [@maxiwee69](https://www.github.com/maxiwee69) made most of the actuall cheat part
- [@cazzwastaken](https://www.github.com/cazzwastaken) made the driver and the the way the usermode communicates with the driver + he made the bhop

## Downloading

You should compile yourself bc i probaly will sometimes forget to upload it but you can get it from [here](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counter-strike-2-a/627119-cs2-kernel-cheat.html)
